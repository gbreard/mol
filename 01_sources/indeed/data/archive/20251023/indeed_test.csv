Pet Media Group (PMG) is a scale\-up that acquires, launches, and develops market\-leading pet marketplaces globally, with over 1\.5 million animals finding new homes through our platforms every year. We currently live in 6 different countries (UK, Sweden, Netherlands, Italy, Spain and most recently US), despite only launching 5 years ago. Here is an example of one of our apps: Pets4Homes.co.uk


The way pets find new loving homes has virtually remained the same for centuries, and we are on a mission to make that process more trusted, safe, and convenient through innovative technology. We’re a young and ambitious team who have built unicorns in the past (e.g. Avito) and we are backed by some of Europe’s leading investors (e.g. Verdane and Otiva) who are early investors in leading companies such as Klarna, CAIA, Apotea and Easypark.

**Who are we looking for?**


As part of our growth, we are expanding our Monetisation team and for that, we are looking for a BE\-focused full stack engineer to join us in our journey towards building great products in the payment processing \& value\-added services, and and improving the user experience in the payment domain.


As a Full stack engineer, we expect you to be familiar with building sophisticated architecture and have an in\-depth understanding of the entire web and application development process. We’re looking for someone with roughly 3 years of experience in engineering, ideally from our current tech stack (see details further down)

### **Requirements**

**What skills do we expect you to have?**


Being part of a fast\-growing scale\-up, we are looking for engineers who are not afraid to build fast, fail fast, and learn from their mistakes. We do not expect you to be a world\-class expert in all technologies used at PMG but we do expect you to be a fast learner and an engineer with a critical and open mindset. A strong proficiency in Javascript is however necessary.

  

* Building apps with **Typescript, Node.JS \& React**
* Understanding of **GraphQL** and its usage in large systems with multiple consumers
* Strong experience with relation databases like **PostgreSQL**
* Experience with **backend testing tools and testing strategies**

  

Prior experience with one (or multiple) of these technologies is helpful \& appreciated.

* Experience with payment processing like **Stripe, Adyen, Braintree**
* Experience with search technologies like **Elasticsearch**
* Experience with monitoring \& observability tools like **Grafana**
* Experience with responsive design \& user experience on mobile web devices
* Experience with UI/component frameworks like **Tailwind**


We expect all candidates to have working proficiency in English to be able to communicate with colleagues from all over the world.

### **Our tech stack**

* Next.js, React, Node.js \& ReactNative (Typescript it is)
* Gitlab runners CI/CD
* Elasticsearch
* Redis
* GraphQL \& PostgreSQL
* Knex, Docker
* Serverless architecture with AWS Lambda
* We are running on AWS
* Observability via Grafana
* App release flow with Bitrise

### **What we offer**

* The ability to join a rapidly growing business with a clear vision, where passion and energy exists in abundance
* A diverse team from various backgrounds \- current team is located in Sweden, Germany, Austria, UK, Poland, Portugal, Bosnia, Croatia, Ukraine and Egypt.
* A unique opportunity to become a part of a rapidly growing (but already profitable) scale\-up where you would be instrumental in building our Tech department
* Competitive compensation and awesome benefits (in person or remote)
